# Electricity Demand Forecasting in South Africa

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electricity supply and distribution in South Africa using monthly data from January 2002 to August 2024 (Stats SA). The goal was to accurately predict future electricity availability and distribution while accounting for trends, seasonality, and external disruptions such as load shedding.

## Methodology
- Conducted time-series analysis and visualised historical data to identify trends and seasonal patterns.
- Implemented forecasting methods, including:
  - Holt-Winters Additive
  - Holt-Winters Multiplicative
  - Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
- Evaluated model performance using metrics: RMSE, MAPE, Theil’s U.
- Visualised forecast results compared to historical data to assess accuracy.

## Key Findings
- Holt-Winters multiplicative method performed best for forecasting total electricity availability, effectively capturing seasonal trends.
- SARIMA model performed best for electricity distribution forecasts.
- Insights from this analysis can guide operational planning and improve energy management.

## Skills Applied
- Time-series forecasting (Holt-Winters, SARIMA)
- Data visualisation and analysis in R
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAPE, and Theil’s U
- Translating data insights into actionable recommendations
